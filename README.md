## Task

The aim of the project was to implement an on-line bookstore where its multimedia contents are about _paper-based books_, _eBooks_ and their _authors_.
The website also includes _events_ where books are presented for promotional purposes by their author.  
Each book is described by a picture, a “fact sheet”, an abstract and a set of reviews; it is related to its authors and to a set of books that are “similar to” it. Each author is described by a picture and a short bio; he/she is related to his/her books and events.  

The website has to offer these two main functionalities: user registration/log-in and book purchase.  
The application shall be responsive and available on various formats (from PCs to smartphones) and shall respect accessibility standards.  
As a human-computer interaction project, the web site shall apply usability Nielsen's heuristic to improve the UX.
