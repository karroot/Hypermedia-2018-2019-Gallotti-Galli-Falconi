    "about": "MDGbooks was born in 2019 from an idea of ​​three friends who decided to combine their programming skills with the passion of reading. We are an independent e-commerce, disconnected from the big publishing houses in order to be free to sell every kind of book, even yours! <br>  We are just born but our hope is to be able to bring readers closer to the authors of their favorite books, let them meet and exchange a chat. For this reason a large part of our site revolves around events and we have decided to make them completely free in order to break down any barriers. <br></br> Our site is built with the most modern technologies in order to have a greater speed of navigation and a better experience for the user. <br> The constant improvement of your shopping experience and the conquest of your trust are what we work for every day, with renewed passion.<br>",
